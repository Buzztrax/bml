0.6.0 black beats blue (xx.xxx.2011)
================================================================================
Main feature of this release is full undo/redo support. Related to it is the
journaling of edit action and the crash recovery. This way chances of losing
changes in the song are quite low. Other UI improvements are: tip of day,
improved spectrum analyzer, clipboard support, more commands in context menus
and many more). This release features a gstreamer decoder that enables playback
of buzztard songs in any gstreamer based media player.
We also kept the buzztard codebase clean and ported from deprecated APIs to the
successors (gnomevfs->gio, hal->gudev). The libraries and the applications got
performance improvements in many areas.
Also the docs have been improved a lot with tutorials, keyboard shortcut tables,
better coverage and man-pages.
