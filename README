= quick info =
Please turn you browser to http://www.buzztard.org to learn what this project
is about. Buzztard is free software and distributed under the LGPL.

= intro =
The libbml is a library that loads buzz machines from the windows music
composer buzz, so that Linux apps can use them.
This lib is either using the libavifile wrapper or the libfst one.
See original README in README.libfst for the latter.

= usage =
For testing, create a folder 'machines' and put some original buzz machines
in there. After building invoke :
  env LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./bml" ./bml/bmltest_info ./machines/mymachine.dll
or alternatively run the testmachine.sh script to probe a whole directory with
machines.

= problems =
== /dev/zero needs to be executable ==
make sure your /dev/zero is executable (needed for mmap() )

== multithreading ==
before calling lib code in multithreaded environments we should call:
Check_FS_Segment();

== windows path names ==
We currently have a problem with long/absolute path. E.g.
  ./bml/bmltest /usr/share/machines/mymachine.dll
does not work. We also tried to put the machines into
  ~/.wine/fake_windows/Program\ Files/Jeskola\ Buzz/Gear/
and then trying
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\Program Files\Jeskola Buzz\Gear\elak_svf.dll'
  ./bml/bmltest "C:\\Program Files\\Jeskola Buzz\\Gear\\elak_svf.dll"
but that failed as well. On the other hand, doing
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\elak_svf.dll'
works! Even doing 
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\Programme\Buzz\Gear\elak_svf.dll'
works! So how the shell escape the spaces.

We now have a method to convert path names, this should map
  $HOME to Y:\
  /     to Z:\
but it always map to Z:
manually using Z: works. The problem with the spaces persists.
