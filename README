* Intro
libbml is a library that loads buzz machines from the windows music
composer buzz, so that linux apps can use them.
This lib is shamelessly based on libfst (C) by Pauls Davis.
See original README in README.libfst.

* Usage
For testing, create a folder 'machines' and put some original buzz machines
in there. After building invoke :
  env LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./bml" ./bml/bmltest_info ./machines/mymachine.dll
or alternatively run the testmachine.sh script to probe a whole directory with
machines.

* Problems
** Windows path names
We currently have a problem with long/absolute path. E.g.
  ./bml/bmltest /usr/share/machines/mymachine.dll
does not work. We also tried to put the machines into
  ~/.wine/fake_windows/Program\ Files/Jekola\ Buzz/Gear/
and then trying
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\Program Files\Jeskola Buzz\Gear\elak_svf.dll'
  ./bml/bmltest "C:\\Program Files\\Jeskola Buzz\\Gear\\elak_svf.dll"
but that failed as well. On the other hand, doing
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\elak_svf.dll'
works! Even doing 
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\Programme\Buzz\Gear\elak_svf.dll'
works! So how the shell escape the spaces.

We now have a method to convert pathnames, this should map
  $HOME to Y:\
  /     to Z:\
but it always map to Z:
manually using Z: works. The problem with the spaces persists.
