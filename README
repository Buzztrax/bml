libbml is a library that loads buzz machines from the windows music
composer buzz, so that linux apps can use them.
This lib is shamelessly based on libfst (C) by Pauls Davis.
See original README in README.libfst.

For testing, create a folder 'machines' and put some original buzz machines
in there. After building invoke :
  ./bml/bmltest ./machines/mymachine.dll
