libbml is a library that loads buzz machines from the windows music
composer buzz, so that linux apps can use them.
This lib is shamelessly based on libfst (C) by Pauls Davis.
See original README in README.libfst.

For testing, create a folder 'machines' and put some original buzz machines
in there. After building invoke :
  ./bml/bmltest ./machines/mymachine.dll

We currently have a problem with long/absolute path. E.g.
  ./bml/bmltest /usr/share/machines/mymachine.dll
does not work. We also tried to put the machines into
  ~/.wine/fake_windows/Program\ Files/Jekola\ Buzz/Gear/
and then trying
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\Program Files\Jeskola Buzz\Gear\elak_svf.dll'
but that failed as well. On the other hand, doing
  ./bml/bmltest 'C:\elak_svf.dll'
works!
